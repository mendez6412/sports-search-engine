# sports-search-engine

## Files
  - explorer.py: A menu (or simple cml) based database explorer for the ever amazing class list of D&D Characters
  - create_db.py: A python file to create and add data from my csv
  - classes.csv: A csv file with names and D&D 5e classes, races and levels
  - random_class_gen.py: A python file to randomly assign classes and races to my friends
  - requirements.txt: A list of required installs to run the python files

## Notes
  - Some may argue that sports-search-engine is a bad repo name for a database search engine about D&D... but we have to be SUBVERSIVE.
  - Having the csv reader handle naming the SQL database column names would be beneficial...
